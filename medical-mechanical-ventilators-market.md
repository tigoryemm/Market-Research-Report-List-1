<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Mechanical Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive Ventilator</li><li>Invasive Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical mechanical ventilator market is primarily divided into two types: non-invasive and invasive ventilators. Non-invasive ventilators provide respiratory support through facial masks or nasal interfaces, allowing patients to breathe without the need for intubation. They are commonly used in conditions like sleep apnea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Invasive ventilators, on the other hand, require endotracheal intubation and are employed in critical care settings for patients with severe respiratory failure, ensuring direct airway management and ventilation.</p></p>
