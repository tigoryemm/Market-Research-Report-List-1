<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Animal Antibacterial Peptide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anionic Peptides</li><li>Cationic Peptide</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The animal antibacterial peptide market is categorized into two primary types: anionic peptides and cationic peptides. Anionic peptides, typically negatively charged, interact with positively charged surfaces of bacteria, potentially disrupting their membranes. In contrast, cationic peptides possess a positive charge, allowing them to bind effectively to bacterial cell walls, leading to cell lysis and death. Both types play crucial roles in developing new antimicrobial agents, enhancing animal health, and addressing antibiotic resistance challenges in livestock and veterinary applications.</p></p>
