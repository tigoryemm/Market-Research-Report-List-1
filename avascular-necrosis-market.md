<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Avascular Necrosis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Trauma Related Avascular Necrosis (AVN)</li><li>Non-Trauma Related Avascular Necrosis (AVN)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The avascular necrosis (AVN) market is divided into two main types: trauma-related AVN and non-trauma-related AVN. Trauma-related AVN occurs due to injuries like fractures or dislocations that disrupt blood supply to the bone. Non-trauma-related AVN, on the other hand, arises from factors such as chronic steroid use, alcohol consumption, or medical conditions that impair blood flow. Both types necessitate different treatment approaches and management strategies, influencing the market dynamics and demand for therapeutic options.</p></p>
