<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lacrimal Duct Stent Tube Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monocanalicular Lacrimal Duct Stent Tube</li><li>Bicanalicular Lacrimal Duct Stent Tube</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lacrimal duct stent tube market is primarily categorized into two types: monocanalicular and bicanalicular stent tubes. Monocanalicular lacrimal duct stent tubes are designed to traverse a single canaliculus, helping to maintain tear drainage by providing a pathway for tears to flow from the eye to the nasal cavity. Bicanalicular stent tubes, on the other hand, pass through both canaliculi, ensuring improved drainage and tear management. Both types are essential for treating conditions like nasolacrimal duct obstructions.</p></p>
