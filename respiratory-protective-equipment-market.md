<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Respiratory Protective Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>APR*</li><li>SAR*</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Respiratory Protective Equipment (RPE) market is primarily categorized into two types: Air-Purifying Respirators (APRs) and Supplied-Air Respirators (SARs). APRs filter harmful contaminants from the air, allowing users to breathe clean air within the surrounding environment. They are commonly used in settings with lower levels of pollutants. In contrast, SARs provide a continuous supply of clean air from a separate source, ideal for environments with high levels of toxic substances or insufficient oxygen. Each type serves specific safety needs.</p></p>
